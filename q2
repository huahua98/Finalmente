A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
Recursion is a powerful general-purpose programming technique,

    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
    termination step is the first line of the loop that determine when the recursion stops.
    Recursion step is the last line of the method that use the method itself in the loop itself.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.
a queue is like a horizontal line , first in first out, a stack is a vertical line and it's first in last out.
C.  Write a class for an element of a doublely-linked list.

public class LOL{
  
  private Object payload;
  private LOL next;
  private LOL prev;
  
   public LOL(LOL next, LOL prev, Object payload){
    this.next = next;
    this.prev=prev;
    this.payload = payload;}
    }
D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    Merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled 
    with the hash of the labels or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes
    What is the Merkle root
    Merkle trees are typically implemented as binary trees where each non-leaf node is a hash of the two nodes below it. 
    The leaves can either be the data itself or a hash/signature of the data.
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    It is way faster than other loops.
